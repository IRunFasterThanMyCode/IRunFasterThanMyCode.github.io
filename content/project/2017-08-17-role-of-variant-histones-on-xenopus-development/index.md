Together with [Professor Matt Guille](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/prof-matt-guille.html) and [Dr. Fiona Myers](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-fiona-myers.html), we are examining development in the model species _Xenopus laevis_. We are using a wide range of techniques, including ChIP-seq to study epigenetic changes and to observe transcription factor binding throughout development, RNA-seq to study changes in gene expression, structural analysis of DNA tertiary structures, and Nanopore sequencing using the [Oxford Nanopore MinION](https://nanoporetech.com) system to look at whole genome changes.
