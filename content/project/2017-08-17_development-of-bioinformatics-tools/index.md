title: Development of Bioinformatics Tools
---

As well as collaborating with researchers from throughout the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, we are also working to develop several tools for use alongside commonly used and freely available analysis tools. These tools will be made available via the University of Portsmouth [GitHub](https://github.com/uopbioinformatics) account. 

This includes development of a next generation sequencing data analysis platform created by Dr. Sam Robson, which allows for processing, mapping and analysis of a number of data types, including data generated from ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, 16S.rDNA amplicon sequencing, whole genome sequencing and ancient DNA sequencing approaches.
