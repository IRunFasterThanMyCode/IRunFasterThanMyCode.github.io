title: Effects of Anti-Fouling Coatings on Marine Biofilms
---

Marine biofilms, or "biofouling", are communities of micro-organisms bound together on a surface by an extracellular matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Biofilms consist predominantly of phytoplankton (particularly diatoms which are photosynthesising algae) and bacteria, which bind to surfaces in the marine environment to form complex 3 dimensional surface structures. 

The formation of these biofilms can affect all types of surfaces in the marine environment, and substrates include such man-made structures as the hulls of ships, nets used by fishing trawlers, pipelines used to transport oil and gas, and boat propellors. Biofilm formation on ships can have a costly impact due to increased drag - for example the increased cost of fuel has been estimated at around $56 million per year for DDG-51 naval ships. 

For this reason, testing novel antifouling substrates that are environmentally benign is of great importance to many marine-based industries. Working together with [Dr. Maria Salta](http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/maria-salta.html) we have been analysing the changes in bacterial communities on different man-made surfaces using next-generation sequencing. This project combines microbiological analysis with both 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing (for populationa analysis) and whole transcriptome sequencing using RNA seq (for gene expression analysis).
