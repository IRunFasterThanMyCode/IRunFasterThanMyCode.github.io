```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## So this is R Markdown, huh?

So all I need to do is to write an R markdown file, click **Knit**, and I am good to go.

## Have a useless plot

Not all of my plots are useless, honest.

```{r useless_plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

## And some useless stats

```{r summary}
summary(rnorm(100))
```
