      <title>Biofilm Composition in Prosthetic Joint Infection</title>
      <link>/project/2020-02-23-biofilm-composition-in-prosthetic-joint-infection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) represents one of the most common reasons for failure among hip and knee arthroplasty, with an incidence of around 1-2%. Infection can occur early (within days of surgery) or late (over a year after surgery), and no specific early markers for infection onset exist. Given the significant costs to the NHS for corrective revision surgery, the added suffering and risks to patients from surgery, and the risk of enhancing antimicrobial resistance through the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, a more specific predictive test for early onset of infection is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 80% of human infection is estimated to be a result of biofilm formation. Biofilms are an accumulation of microorganisms on a surface, resulting in a functional community which provides antibiotic resistance and a beneficial environment for the growth of pathogenic species that would otherwise be removed by the body’s defences. Biofilms can rupture, allowing pathogens to spread infection. To date, biofilm development and diversity on periprosthetic implants is poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are exploring biofilm formation on hip joint prostheses using techniques including next generation sequencing (NGS) and 3D phase-contrast X-ray microscopy, and aim to compare bacterial diversity and biofilm structure between infected and non-infected samples. Our goal is to identify novel biomarkers using an innovative inter-disciplinary approach, which can be tested in a clinical setting in a sustainable and highly impactful research program.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Center for Enzyme Innovation</title>
      <link>/project/2019-06-18-center-for-enzyme-innovation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/2019-06-18-center-for-enzyme-innovation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Centre for Enzyme Innovation is a new initiative set up at the University of Portsmouth, with a goal to find solutions to some of the most pressing global environmental problems. In particular, we aim to examine environmental samples to find how the natural world has solved the problem of plastic pollution, by identifying microorganisms who have evolved to be able to break down plastics in the environment. By identifying these microorgansisms, and further understanding the enzymatic methods that they use towards this goal, we aim to harness the amazing work that nature has done, and find ways to enhance this and scale it up on an industrial scale to allow their use in circular recycling of plastics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Centre was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.port.ac.uk/enquire/news/portsmouth-scientists-awarded-major-plastics-funding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;recently awarded £5.8 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding from the Research England Expanding Excellence Fund. Together with significant investment from the University of Portsmouth, we aim to use this funding to speed up our progress towards finding a solution to one of the world’s greatest environmental challenges – plastic waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be working in the Discovery phase of the pipeline, aiming to use next generation &lt;a href=&#34;https://nanoporetech.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nanopore&lt;/a&gt; sequencing to explore microorganisms present on samples taken from environmental sites of interest (e.g. plastic receycling centres) to try and profile what is present and how they have developed to survive on plastic substrates. We aim to use this bioprospecting approach to explore metagenomics and metatranscriptomics of samples to identify mechanisms of action for plastic degaradation, and in particular to compare with previously explored species to identify what makes these species unique. This information, and information on the make-up of enzymes involved in the processes, will feed through the pipeline to be further engineered to create enzymes that can be scaled up on an industrial scale. These data will be combined with data from public repositories to feed into novel machine learning algorithms to help to train algorithms for the identification of further potential candidates for feeding through the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Portsmouth Heritage Hub</title>
      <link>/project/2019-06-18-portsmouth-heritage-hub/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/2019-06-18-portsmouth-heritage-hub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Portsmouth Heritage Hub was set up by Dr Sam Robson, Dr Robert Inkpen and Dr Garry Scarlett, and aims to provide a centralised hub for researchers within the University of Portsmouth currently working on projects involving preservation, conservation, interpretation and education about our local cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Solent, and the surrounding Wessex area has a rich array of history. Portsmouth’s Historic Dockyard, home to world famous ships such as the Mary Rose and HMS Victory, attracts thousands of visitors from around the world, and provides a window into the life of sailors throughout the ages and how this has shaped the City today. The Isle of Wight has proved to be one of the richest sources of dinosaur fossils in all of Europe,  and has earned it the title of the UK’s Dinosaur Capital. Fishbourne Roman. Palace in Chichester is the largest Roman residential building to have been discovered in Britain, and offers a unique glimpse into the life of  Britons following the Roman conquest. And of course, Portsmouth will today play host to Royalty and international leaders to celebrate its part in the D-Day landings in Normandy, one of the most important operations in World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The skills and expertise of researchers throughout the University are multifaceted and span a wide range of themes and fields. These include (but are not limited to) expertise with ancient DNA analysis to understand our past, identifying novel ways to preserve monuments and buildings, interpretation of ancient texts and oral histories, and using modern technology such as virtual reality to provide interactive ways to engage the public with their past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many more projects besides, and our aim is to provide a framework for these researchers to work together with local stakeholders in historical monuments, buildings and other sites to identify ways to improve the heritage of our local area, to interpret our history to better inform our understanding of our past, and to provide new and interesting ways to engage the local area with our history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/2017-08-17-development-of-bioinformatics-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As well as collaborating with researchers from throughout the School of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, we are also working to develop several tools for use alongside commonly used and freely available analysis tools. These tools will be made available via the University of Portsmouth &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/uopbioinformatics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This includes development of a next generation sequencing data analysis platform created by Dr. Sam Robson, which allows for processing, mapping and analysis of a number of data types, including data generated from ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq, 16S.rDNA amplicon sequencing, whole genome sequencing and ancient DNA sequencing approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genotyping of Ancient DNA from Crew Members from the Mary Rose</title>
      <link>/project/2017-09-29-genotyping-of-crew-members-of-the-mary-rose/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/2017-09-29-genotyping-of-crew-members-of-the-mary-rose/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Built in Portsmouth in 1510, the Mary Rose was the flagship of the fleet of Henry VIII, and had a long and lustrious career until it capsized north of the Isle of Wight in the Battle of the Solent in 1545. Fewer than 35 of the roughly 400 crew members escaped. The wreck was discovered in 1971, and following years of excavation activities the hull was raised from the seabed in 1982 and transported to its home port of Portsmouth. Since then, years of archaeological work has been carried out on the hull itself and on the nearly 20,000 artefacts that have so far been discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/dr-garry-scarlett.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr Garry Scarlett&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Portsmouth, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maryrose.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mary Rose Museum&lt;/a&gt;, we will be looking to understand more about the members of the crew by working on genotyping of the ancient DNA from the skeletons of crew members raised from the wreckage. Using whole genome sequencing techniques, we hope to develop an understanding of phenotypic characteristics, disease traits and geographic information of crew members of one of the most famous ship wrecks in history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Anti-Fouling Coatings on Marine Biofilms</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17-anti-fouling-marine-biofilms/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17-anti-fouling-marine-biofilms/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marine biofilms, or &amp;ldquo;biofouling&amp;rdquo;, are communities of micro-organisms bound together on a surface by an extracellular matrix composed of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Biofilms consist predominantly of phytoplankton (particularly diatoms which are photosynthesising algae) and bacteria, which bind to surfaces in the marine environment to form complex 3 dimensional surface structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formation of these biofilms can affect all types of surfaces in the marine environment, and substrates include such man-made structures as the hulls of ships, nets used by fishing trawlers, pipelines used to transport oil and gas, and boat propellors. Biofilm formation on ships can have a costly impact due to increased drag - for example the increased cost of fuel has been estimated at around $56 million per year for DDG-51 naval ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, testing novel antifouling substrates that are environmentally benign is of great importance to many marine-based industries. Working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-biological-sciences/staff/maria-salta.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Dr. Maria Salta&lt;/a&gt; we have been analysing the changes in bacterial communities on different man-made surfaces using next-generation sequencing. This project combines microbiological analysis with both 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing (for populationa analysis) and whole transcriptome sequencing using RNA seq (for gene expression analysis).&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>/project/2017-08-17-effect-of-radiation-exposure-on-fish/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to radiation can have deleterious effects on gene expression regulation, particularly due to increased DNA damage and deregulation of DNA damage checkpoint pathways. Working together with Dr. Adelaide Lerebours, we are performing differential expression analyses to understand the effects of radiation on 3-spined stickleback under laboratory conditions, and in particular attempting to characterise the differences between normal and abnormal offspring of exposed parents to understand how mutations are passed down through the lineage. In addition, we are looking at the effects of radiation exposure in the field, by looking at the effects of radiation exposure on lakes around the Chernobyl nuclear power station which suffered a catastrophic meltdown in 1986. The effects of this are still being felt today, and this project will allow us to understand the negative impact that this disaster has had on aquatic life in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gene Expression Profiling of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy</title>
      <link>/project/2017-08-17-expression-profiling-of-dmd/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/project/2017-08-17-expression-profiling-of-dmd/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive form of muscular dystrophy typically presenting in boys at around the age of four. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which is the largest gene in the genome with 79 exons encoding a range of dystrophin proteins. These proteins are expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles and also in brain and other non-muscle tissues, where they have specific roles. Their absence due to DMD mutations causes specific abnormalities such as progressive muscle weakness and wasting and cognitive deficits. Muscle weakness begins in the upper legs and pelvis but quickly spreads until boys are unable to walk and eventually cannot breathe unaided.  As yet, no cure exists for DMD, despite it being the most common form of muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.port.ac.uk/school-of-pharmacy-and-biomedical-sciences/staff/prof-darek-gorecki.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Professor Darek Gorecki&lt;/a&gt;, we are using RNA seq analysis to identify the changes in expression associated with a point mutation in the Dmd gene in a dystrophic mouse model. By identifying the pathways most impacted by the dystrophic phenotype, we hope to identify novel areas for future therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
